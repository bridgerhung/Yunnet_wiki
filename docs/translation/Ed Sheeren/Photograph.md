"Photograph"

Loving can hurt

愛是雙面刃

Loving can hurt sometimes

愛有時使人受傷

But it's the only thing that I know

但我深知

When it gets hard

當愛變得困難

You know it can get hard sometimes

有時愛面臨很多挑戰

It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

我們才會學著體驗生命

We keep this love in a photograph

愛在相片裡留存。

We made these memories for ourselves

留存著我們創造的回憶。

Where our eyes are never closing

回憶裡的我們，從不闔眼

Hearts are never broken

愛便永恆不變

Times forever frozen still

美好永遠凍結

So you can keep me

所以你可以，將我

Inside the pocket

放進你的口袋

Of your ripped jeans

Holdin' me closer

把我緊緊摟著

'Til our eyes meet

直到我們雙眼對視

You won't ever be alone

你就不會感到寂寞

Wait for me to come home

等待我回家

Loving can heal

愛可療傷

Loving can mend your soul

愛可以修復靈魂

And it's the only thing that I know

我深信不渝

(know)

I swear it will get easier

我發誓，一切將回歸單純

Remember that with every piece of ya

記著生命中的美好片刻

And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

這是唯一我們可以帶離人世的

We keep this love in this photograph

愛封存在集錦

We made these memories for ourselves

回憶隨之留存

Where our eyes are never closing

在裡面的我們，從不闔眼

Hearts were never broken

心從未分離

Times forever frozen still

時間永遠靜止

So you can keep me

所以你可以，將我

Inside the pocket

回憶在一張相片裡

Of your ripped jeans

放在口袋

Holdin' me closer

將我抱緊

'Til our eyes meet

直到我們雙眼對視

You won't ever be alone

你就感覺不到孤單

And if you hurt me

如果你傷到我

That's OK, baby, only words bleed

那無所謂，因為只有利嘴能讓我受傷

Inside these pages you just hold me

And I won't ever let you go

Wait for me to come home [4x]

Oh you can fit me

Inside the necklace you got when you were 16

Next to your heartbeat

Where I should be

Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me

Well, that's OK, baby, only words bleed

Inside these pages you just hold me

And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away

I will remember how you kissed me

Under the lamppost

Back on 6th street

Hearing you whisper through the phone,

"Wait for me to come home."
